Yes/No Animal-Guessing Binary Tree created for Oracle course

This game is a console-based learning program that is based on a basic binary tree logic design.
The program is pre-loaded with 5 animal classifications [Mammal, Reptile, Bird, Aquatics, and Bugs] as to give the user something to get started, while keeping it simple.

I intend on building on this to create a more complex, GUI-based design in the future that will group nodes based on questions and position them according to their popularity.
